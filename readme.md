# Smart Contract Auditing 70-Day Challenge üöÄ

## Challenge Overview
I am committing to a **70-day challenge** to enhance my skills in **smart contract auditing**, aiming to become a **professional security researcher**. Every day, I will work on auditing techniques, tools, and methodologies, documenting my progress on GitHub.

## Challenge Goals
- Gain expertise in **smart contract auditing** and security best practices.
- Master **security tools** like Mythril, Manticore, Slither, and others.
- Develop **real-world auditing skills** through hands-on projects.
- Contribute to open-source security research.
- Maintain consistent documentation for effective learning and tracking.

| --- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 2025-02-24 | Solved one or two Ethernaut challenges, completed 3 hours of a security course (0-3), learned Foundry functionalities, referred to Solidity docs, studied fuzzing and invariants. | Focused on fundamentals.                                       |
| 2   | 2025-02-25 | Completed the PasswordAudit, revised Solidity basics, reviewed Foundry tools, and reinforced fundamental auditing techniques.                                                     | Strengthened basics and vulnerability detection skills.        |
| 3   | 2025-02-26 | Completed the Ethernaut CTF challenge *MagicAnimal*, performed various attack simulations, and gained a better understanding of the ECDSA algorithm.                              | Explored Solidity's internal structure through CTF challenges. |
| 4   | 2025-02-28 | Audited the *puppyRaffle* contract, identified **reentrancy, arithmetic overflow, and DoS attacks**, and enhanced my auditing process.                                            | Gaining confidence in contract auditing and daily progress.    |
| 5   | 2025-03-01 | Learned the basics of **fuzzing**, participated in two Ethernaut challenges, and deepened my understanding of **ECDSA mechanisms**.                                               | Focused on security tools for smart contract analysis.         |
| 6   | 2025-03-02 | I solve the Impersnator challenge in the ethernaut ctf,I was written many test to find the vulnerability and also i learn ecdsa signatures working mechanism                      | focussed on Impersantor challenge                              |
